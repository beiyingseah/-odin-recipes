   <img src="../images/carrotcake.jpeg" alt="A picture of pan-fried carrot cake with egg, black and white version taking up half of the plate each."">
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Do not confuse this with the dessert carrot cake, a moist cake made with carrot and spices; covered with cream cheese frosting. This savoury carrot cake has no carrot, at least not of the orange variety. Instead, the core ingredients of the cake are rice flour and white radish, which some call white carrot. The mixture is steamed, then cut into cubes and fried with garlic, eggs and preserved radish called 'chai poh'.</p>
   <p>Commonly referred to as 'chai tow kway' in the Teochew dialect, these smooth and soft fried rice cakes can be found in almost every hawker centre. It is served black (fried with sweet dark soya sauce) or white (original).</p>
